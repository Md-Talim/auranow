# 🌤️ AuraNow

Hi, I’m building **AuraNow** – a modern weather app for the [Frontend Mentor 30-Day Hackathon](https://www.frontendmentor.io/articles/introducing-the-frontend-mentor-30-day-hackathon).

I’m using **Next.js + TypeScript** (with Tailwind CSS for styling) and the **Open-Meteo API** to fetch real weather data.
The goal is to make it clean, responsive, and a little more fun than a plain weather app.

## 🛠️ Current Status

🚧 Work in progress – I’m actively coding this project.
I’ll be pushing updates regularly as I add features and polish the UI.

## 🔗 Live Demo

I’ll deploy on Vercel soon. Stay tuned for the link here!

## ✨ Planned Features

- Search weather by city/location
- Show current temperature, feels-like, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation
- 7-day forecast with hourly breakdown
- Toggle between °C/°F and metric/imperial units
- Responsive design and accessible UI
- Maybe some extras like favorites, dark mode, or animated backgrounds 🌙

## 💡 Why AuraNow?

I wanted a short, clean name that feels modern but still ties to weather.
“Aura” means air/atmosphere, and “Now” highlights real-time updates.
So basically: _AuraNow = the atmosphere right now._
